### Hello!

This Github was a dumping ground for a lot of school projects and is mostly used to store and host my [personal website](http://susannahjones.com). As of September 2020 I will be working on some awesome, likely NDA'd stuff with [Wolfjaw Studios](https://wolfjawstudios.com/). Eventually I'd love to publish some personal Unreal projects here (I've got a whole bunch of ideas, but yet to actually implement 😊).
