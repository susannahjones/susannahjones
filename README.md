### Hello!

This Github was a dumping ground for a lot of school projects and is mostly used to store my [personal website](http://susannahjones.com). Most of my work is NDA and I'm currently working on [THPS 1+2](https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/) with the awesome folks at Vicarious Visions. Eventually I'd love to publish some personal Unreal projects here (I've got a whole bunch of ideas, but yet to actually implement 😊).
